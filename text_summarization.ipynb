It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

      "Speech:The speech is the departing address of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, after completing five years in office. He expresses gratitude to everyone who has worked with him and shares his experiences and messages during his tenure. The speech highlights 10 key messages, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Focusing on agriculture (Seed to Food)\n",
      "5. Defeating problems and succeeding\n",
      "6. Overcoming problems through partnership\n",
      "7. Showing courage in the face of calamities\n",
      "8. Promoting connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "9. Defending the nation\n",
      "10. Encouraging a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. Kalam assures her that it's a thoughtful question and expresses his commitment to working towards India's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was asked by Anukriti \"why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020\". The speaker appreciated the question and assured Anukriti that her query would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work towards making her dream a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. The speaker, likely the President of India at the time, shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland where they saw a prosperous and empowered village council functioning effectively. They express the desire to see this transformation replicated across India's 600,000 villages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also highlights the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has established a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex in 65 villages, providing physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity. This has led to the creation of health care centers, primary to post-graduate education, vocational training, and employment generation, resulting in the emergence of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering rural areas and promoting competitiveness through the creation of urban amenities and infrastructure in rural areas, with the aim of achieving a prosperous and developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) project in Thanjavur district. The project has established level education and vocational training centers, leading to large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs. The villagers have developed skills in cultivating land, planting Jatropha and medicinal plants, and processing food. The project has also enabled the production of internationally competitive products, with the help of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). The project has enhanced the innovative ability of the villagers and has the potential to bridge the rural-urban divide by establishing similar projects across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences. The first experience was meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the nation's economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They also express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience was meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who was born without hands and legs, but had a radiant smile and a positive attitude. Despite his physical limitations, he was confident and expressed a desire to sing in front of the speaker. The speaker was moved by his story and the confidence he exuded, and the experience left them with a sense of defeat of the problems and a desire to succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspirational stories. The first story is about a physically challenged person who has a latent talent for music. With the encouragement of his parents, teachers, and academics, he was able to develop his talent and even performed in front of the speaker. The speaker emphasizes the importance of a positive attitude and perseverance in overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage to their school and homes, the villagers had a strong spirit and were determined to rebuild their lives. The speaker praises the courage of the villagers in overcoming their problems and taking charge of their lives, rather than letting the problems define them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the speaker's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters. The speaker recalls visiting a village after an earthquake and witnessing the bravery of the children and villagers as they participated in relief operations with the Armed Forces. The speaker also shares a personal experience from 2005, when they visited Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami and met with the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children of Chuckchucha village. The speaker was touched by the islanders' unique trait of accepting victims as their own children, rather than leaving them in orphanages. The speaker then recites a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which celebrates the resilience of the islanders. Finally, the speaker mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in 2004, but the content of the speech is not provided in the summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker addressed the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa on September 16, 2004, proposing the concept of a Pan African e-Network. The estimated cost of the project is $100 million. The network will connect 53 African countries with satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks. The project will connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, which will allow Ethiopian students to take an MBA course with Indian universities and receive tele-medicine services from specialists in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the following points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker's organization (Hyderabad) is providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, since November 2006, utilizing the Pan African network for instant communication.\n",
      "2. The speaker is proud of the Indian experience in bringing technology to the people, which has enabled collaboration with Africa to bring societal transformation to the continent.\n",
      "3. The speaker shares personal experiences of visiting the Indian Army's KUMAR post in Siachen Glacier, the INS Sindhurakshak submarine, and a Sukhoi-30 fighter jet, which made them feel proud of the bravery and dedication of Indian soldiers, sailors, and air warriors.\n",
      "4. The speaker acknowledges the contributions of the Defense Forces, para-military forces, and internal security forces in protecting the nation and ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "5. The speaker mentions a recent meeting with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program that aims to transform young people into enlightened citizens. The program, headed by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, has been implemented in many districts of Andhra Pradesh and has shown positive results. The speaker mentions specific examples, such as students in Medak district, who have developed self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and confidence. He also shares a personal story of a student who influenced her father to quit smoking after participating in the program. The speaker concludes that the program is empowering young people through value-based education and leadership, and that the 540 million youth below the age of 25 in India are a powerful resource that can be harnessed to build a better future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich and diverse culture and civilization for future generations. They highlight the country's progress in the last 60 years, its natural resources, and its hardworking people, particularly the 540 million youth.
